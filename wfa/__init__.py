"""
Walk-Forward Analysis (WFA) Framework with HMM Regime Detection

This module provides a dynamic backtesting suite that uses Hidden Markov Models
to identify market regimes (Bull, Bear, Volatile) and adjusts portfolio policy
accordingly through walk-forward analysis.

# Uncomment once the rest of the package is implemented
# THis allows the wfa directory as a Python package that can be imported
# the config file defines the configuration dataclasses
# the walk_forward file defines the main WFA logic
